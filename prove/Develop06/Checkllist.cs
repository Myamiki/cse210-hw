/*The ChecklistGoal class represents a goal that tracks progress toward a specific target. 
It inherits from the Goal class and adds three new properties: amountCompleted ,target and bonus. 

The constructor sets the initial values for these properties. 
The RecordEvent() method increases amountCompleted when a task is completed, but only if the target hasn't been reached.

The IsComplete() method checks if the target is met. 

The GetDetailsString() method returns a summary of the goal, while the ToFileString() method formats the goalâ€™s data for saving to a file.
This class helps track and manage checklist-style goals. */
